# iOSAndroidCryptography
Implementation for encrypting and decrypting across both iOS (Obj-C) and Android (Java). My goal was to have a simple library/class that I can use so that I can encrypt on 1 platform and decrypt on another. Hopefully this could help other people who want to encrypt data as well. 

This is based heavily if not completely on the AES Cryptography found here https://github.com/rnapier/ios5ptl/tree/master/ch11/CryptPic/CryptPic
